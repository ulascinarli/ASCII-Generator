# ASCII-Generator
This is a small program I wrote to convert image files to ASCII

How To Use:

-Run the .py file in Terminal (Linux-sudo) or in Command Prompt (Windows)

-Enter the File Path for the image

-It will both show an output of the ASCII in Terminal and will create a file named ascii_image.txt in the same folder

Done!
